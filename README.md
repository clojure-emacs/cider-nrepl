# CIDER nREPL

A collection of [nREPL](https://github.com/clojure/tools.nrepl) middleware designed to enhance
[CIDER](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider).

If you're just a user trying to get started with CIDER, then you
probably don't want to read this. You should follow the steps in
[CIDER's Readme](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider) instead.

If you're trying to use cider-nrepl for some other purpose, the
sections below outline how to include it in a project.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

`cider-nrepl` supports only Clojure(Script) 1.7+ and Java 7+.

Leiningen users will need to have version 2.5.2 or newer installed.

### Via Leiningen

Use the convenient plugin for defaults, either in your project's
`project.clj` file or in the `:user` profile in
`~/.lein/profiles.clj`.

```clojure
:plugins [[cider/cider-nrepl "0.13.0"]]
```

A minimal `profiles.clj` for CIDER would be:

```clojure
{:user {:plugins [[cider/cider-nrepl "0.13.0"]]}}
```

Or (if you know what you're doing) add `cider-nrepl` to your `:dev :dependencies` vector plus specific
middleware to `:nrepl-middleware` under `:repl-options`.

```clojure
:dependencies [[cider/cider-nrepl "0.13.0"]]
:repl-options {:nrepl-middleware
                 [cider.nrepl.middleware.apropos/wrap-apropos
                  cider.nrepl.middleware.classpath/wrap-classpath
                  cider.nrepl.middleware.complete/wrap-complete
                  cider.nrepl.middleware.debug/wrap-debug
                  cider.nrepl.middleware.format/wrap-format
                  cider.nrepl.middleware.info/wrap-info
                  cider.nrepl.middleware.inspect/wrap-inspect
                  cider.nrepl.middleware.macroexpand/wrap-macroexpand
                  cider.nrepl.middleware.ns/wrap-ns
                  cider.nrepl.middleware.pprint/wrap-pprint
                  cider.nrepl.middleware.pprint/wrap-pprint-fn
                  cider.nrepl.middleware.refresh/wrap-refresh
                  cider.nrepl.middleware.resource/wrap-resource
                  cider.nrepl.middleware.stacktrace/wrap-stacktrace
                  cider.nrepl.middleware.test/wrap-test
                  cider.nrepl.middleware.trace/wrap-trace
                  cider.nrepl.middleware.out/wrap-out
                  cider.nrepl.middleware.undef/wrap-undef
                  cider.nrepl.middleware.version/wrap-version]}

```

Note that you should use a `cider-nrepl` version compatible with your CIDER. Generally, if you're
using CIDER 0.x.y you should be using `cider-nrepl` 0.x.y, if you're using CIDER 0.x.y-SNAPSHOT, you should be
using `cider-nrepl` 0.x.y-SNAPSHOT, etc.

#### Via Boot

Boot users can configure the tool to include the middleware automatically in
all of their projects using a `~/.boot/profile.boot` file like so:

```clojure
(require 'boot.repl)

(swap! boot.repl/*default-dependencies*
       concat '[[cider/cider-nrepl "0.13.0"]])

(swap! boot.repl/*default-middleware*
       conj 'cider.nrepl/cider-middleware)
```

For more information visit [boot-clj wiki](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/wiki/Cider-REPL).

### Via embedding nREPL in your app

If you're embedding nREPL in your application you'll have to start the
server with CIDER's own nREPL handler.

```clojure
(ns my-app
  (:require [clojure.tools.nrepl.server :as nrepl-server]
            [cider.nrepl :refer (cider-nrepl-handler)]))

(defn -main
  []
  (nrepl-server/start-server :port 7888 :handler cider-nrepl-handler))
```

### With JBoss AS/JBoss EAP/WildFly

Using the advanced features of the `info` middleware with one of the
JBoss application servers requires a tweak, since JBoss modules
prevent modifications to `AppClassLoader` (usually the highest
modifiable classloader) from being seen by application code. To work
around this, run the following code from within your application
to mark that classloader as unmodifiable, and cause the lower level
`clojure.lang.DynamicClassLoader` to be used instead. This code must
execute prior to loading the `cider-nrepl` middleware. Note that this
is only if you are deploying a standard WAR file to the application
server directly. If you are using [Immutant](http://immutant.org/)
(1.x or 2.x), you won't need to do this.

```clj
(require '[dynapath.dynamic-classpath :as cp])

(extend sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader
  cp/DynamicClasspath
  (assoc cp/base-readable-addable-classpath
    :classpath-urls #(seq (.getURLs %))
    :can-add? (constantly false)))
```


## Supplied nREPL middleware

Middleware        | Op(s)      | Description
------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------
`wrap-apropos`    | `apropos`  | Pattern search for symbols and documentation.
`wrap-classpath`  | `classpath` | Java classpath.
`wrap-complete`   | `complete` | Simple completion. Supports both Clojure & ClojureScript.
`wrap-debug`      | `init-debugger/debug-input` | Establish a channel for `cider-debug` commands, use it to get debug input, and also wrap the eval op.
`wrap-format`     | `format-(code/edn)` | Code and data formatting.
`wrap-info`       | `info/eldoc` | File/line, arglists, docstrings and other metadata for vars.
`wrap-inspect`    |`inspect-(start/refresh/pop/push/reset)` | Inspect a Clojure expression.
`wrap-macroexpand`| `macroexpand/macroexpand-1/macroexpand-all/macroexpand-step` | Macroexpand a Clojure form.

`wrap-trace`      | `toggle-trace-var`/`toggle-trace-ns` | Toggle tracing of a given var or ns.
`wrap-out`        | | Echo the server's output stream to client sessions.
`wrap-undef`      | `undef`    | Undefine a var.
`wrap-version`    | `cider-version` | The CIDER-nREPL version map.

## Release policy

Weâ€™re following [SemVer](http://semver.org/) (as much as one can be
following it when the major version is 0). At this point bumps of the
minor (second) version number are considered major releases and always
include new features or significant changes to existing features. API
compatibility between major releases is not a (big) concern (although we try
to break the API rarely and only for a good reason).

The development cycle for the next major
release starts immediately after the previous one has been
shipped. Bugfix/point releases (if any) address only serious bugs and
never contain new features.

The versions of CIDER and cider-nrepl are always kept in sync. If
you're tracking the `master` branch of CIDER, you should also be
tracking the `master` branch of `cider-nrepl`.

### Discussion

For questions, suggestions and support refer to our [official mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cider-emacs)
or the Freenode channel `#clojure-emacs`.
Please, don't report issues there, as this makes them harder to track.

### Issues

Report issues and suggest features and improvements on the
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl/issues). Don't
ask questions on the issue tracker - the mailing list and the IRC
channel are the places for questions.

### Patches

Patches under any form are always welcome! GitHub pull requests are even better! :-)

Before submitting a patch or a pull request make sure all tests are
passing and that your patch is in line with the [contribution
guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Working with mranderson (inlining dependencies)

[mranderson](https://github.com/benedekfazekas/mranderson) is used to
avoid classpath collisions.

To work with `mranderson` the first thing to do is:

```
lein do clean, source-deps :project-prefix cider.inlined-deps
```

This creates the munged local dependencies in `target/srcdeps` directory.

After that you can run your tests or your REPL with:

```
lein with-profile +plugin.mranderson/config repl
lein with-profile +plugin.mranderson/config test
```

Note the `+` sign before the leiningen profile. For this leiningen
profile to work **you need leiningen version 2.5.0+!** If you want to
use `mranderson` while developing locally with the REPL the source has
to be modified in the `target/srcdeps` directory. When you want to
release locally:

```
lein with-profile plugin.mranderson/config install
```

Release to clojars:

```
lein with-profile plugin.mranderson/config deploy clojars
```

Or you can use the very sophisticated script to clean, inline, test
and run an end target like install or deploy:

```
./build.sh install
./build.sh deploy clojars
```

[build.sh](build.sh) cleans, runs source-deps with the right
parameters, runs the tests and then runs the provided lein target.
