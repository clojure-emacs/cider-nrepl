Before submitting a PR make sure the following things have been done:

- [ ] The commits are consistent with our [contribution guidelines](../blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [ ] You've added tests to cover your change(s)
- [ ] All tests are passing
- [ ] You've updated the README (if adding/changing middleware)

**Note:** If you're just starting out to hack on `cider-nrepl` you might find
[nREPL's documentation](https://nrepl.org) and the
"Design" section of the README extremely useful.*

Thanks!
