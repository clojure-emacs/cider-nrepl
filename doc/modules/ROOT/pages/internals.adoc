= CIDER nREPL Internals

== Lazy middleware loading

Eager loading of all of `cider-nrepl`'s middleware resulted in a significant impact to the
startup time of the nREPL server. To mitigate this we've devised a strategy to postpone
the actual initialization of some middleware until the first time it's actually used
by a client.

That's the reason why middleware description in `cider-nrepl` are not following the common
nREPL convention to be supplied in the same file where the middleware is defined.

== Dealing with unhandled exception

Even though nREPL requests are asynchronous in their nature, some editors might be forced
to wait for the response of a request. This is obviously going to result in lock-up in
case of an unhandled exception, that's why `cider-nrepl` introduced the concept of
a "safe transport" that does some reasonable handling of such errors.

== Operating on unresolved symbols

All middleware ops operating on some symbol that needs to be resolved would normally do the
resolution themselves. They typically take as parameters `ns` and `sym`, which are current
namespace and a symbol in it, and would resolve `sym` in the context of `ns`.

This spares users from having to invoke `info` on every symbol before passing the resolved result
to another op. It also maps well to the typical editor workflow - normally you'd be asking
for some operation to be performed for some unresolved symbol in the current namespace.

== ClojureScript Support

Currently the ClojureScript support relies on inspecting the ClojureScript compiler
state. `cider-nrepl` would fetch the compiler state from Piggieback and pass it
to the underlying libraries (e.g. `orchard` and `clj-suitable`) that do something useful with it.

Unfortunately the majority of the middleware don't support ClojureScript
currently, as they are implemented in terms of Clojure-only libraries. Another
roadblock is that `cider-nrepl` runs in a Clojure context and you have to jump
through some hoops to evaluate ClojureScript code from it (e.g. pipe it to
Piggieback's `eval` or evaluate it against the ClojureScript runtime directly as
a string). Hopefully this will change down the road.

== Dependency obfuscation

`cider-nrepl`'s dependency would conflict with the dependencies of the application using it,
so we have to take some care to avoid such situation.

All of cider-nrepl's dependencies are processed with
https://github.com/benedekfazekas/mranderson[mranderson], so that
they won't collide with the dependencies of your own projects. This
basically means that cider-nrepl doesn't have any runtime dependencies in
the production artifact - just copies of the deps inlined with changed
namespaces/packages.

This means that `cider-nrepl` has to also take some steps to hide the inlined namespaces,
so they won't pollute the results users would be interested in. Pretty much all of `cider-nrepl`'s
ops would filter out the inlined namespaces.
