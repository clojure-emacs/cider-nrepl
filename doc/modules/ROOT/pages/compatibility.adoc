= Compatibility

== Java

`cider-nrepl` officially targets Java 8, Java 11 and the most recent rapid
release version (e.g. Java 13).  More generally speaking - we aim
to support all Java releases that are currently officially supported
by Oracle.

== Clojure

`cider-nrepl` targets Clojure 1.8+. As Clojure doesn't have the concept of supported releases
we have to get a bit creative to determine the minimum version to target.

The minimum required Clojure version is currently derived using data
from the
https://clojure.org/news/2019/02/04/state-of-clojure-2019[State of
Clojure] survey. In general we consider a Clojure release eligible for
dropping once its usage drops bellow 5%, but we'd not drop support for
any release just for the sake of doing it. We'd do it only if
this would lessen the maintenance burden or open up the possibility for
big nREPL improvements.

== ClojureScript

Currently we apply the same policy for Clojure and ClojureScript support.

NOTE: ClojureScript support is contingent on the Piggieback middleware.
Currently `cider-nrepl` requires Piggieback 0.4+ to work properly.

== nREPL

`cider-nrepl` supports nREPL 0.6+.

NOTE: We pay special attention to supporting whatever nREPL is bundled with the current stable Leiningen
and Boot releases.

== Compatibility Matrix

Below you can find the official compatibility matrix for `cider-nrepl`. For a
very long time the project targeted nREPL 0.2.x, but the
requirements were bumped to nREPL 0.6 in recent versions.

== Backwards Compatibility

`cider-nrepl` is under active development and breaking changes might happen from
time to time. That being said, we're well aware that these days many editors and
other Clojure development tools rely on `cider-nrepl` and we're fully committed
to avoid introducing painful breakages there.

Most tools authors using `cider-nrepl` are involved with its development in
some capacity, so we're always considering carefully any proposed breaking change
and the impact it would have.

It's extremely unlikely that we're going to break compatibility on the
protocol level ever (with the rare cases of changing/removing things
that existed, but we knew for a fact weren't used).  Most often
backwards compatibility would be broken on the implementation level -
usually extracting something out of `cider-nrepl` to the `orchard` library.
