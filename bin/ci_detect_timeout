# A successful ClojureScript build takes 2~3 minutes, however sometimes it will
# block until CI times out, and we're not sure yet why.
#
# To further diagnose this issue we now start a background shell which after five
# minutes will print the stacktraces of all threads of all active JVMs using
# jcmd/jstack. Hopefully this provides some insight in what/where the tests get
# stuck.
#
# Additionally this kills all Java processes after five minutes so CI finishes a
# little quicker.
