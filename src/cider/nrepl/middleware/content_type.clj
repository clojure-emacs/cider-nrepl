(ns cider.nrepl.middleware.content-type
  "Rich content handling for CIDER.
  Mostly derived from the pprint middleware.

  ---

  In the long ago, @technomancy [1] talked about his vision for using
  nREPL to support multimedia results beyond plain text, ala DrRacket
  and other \"rich\" REPLs. There was an initial cut at this [2],
  which never became part of the mainline Emacs tooling.

  The goal of this module is to provide some support for recognizing
  multimedia objects (images and URIs thereto) as the result of
  evaluation, so that they can be rendered by a REPL.

  The design of this module is based heavily on RFC-2045 [3] which
  describes messages packaged with `Content-Type`,
  `Content-Transfer-Encoding` and of course a body in that it seeks to
  provide decorated responses which contain metadata which a client
  can use to provide a rich interpretation.

  There's also RFC-2017 [4] which defines the `message/external-body`
  MIME type for defining messages which don't contain their own
  bodies.

  The basic architecture of this changeset is that eval results are
  inspected, and matched against two fundamental supported cases. One
  is that the value is actually a binary Java image, which can be MIME
  encoded and transmitted back directly. The other is that the object
  is some variant of a URI (such as a file naming an image or other
  content) which cannot be directly serialized. In this second case we
  send an RFC-2017 response which provides the URL from which a client
  could request the nREPL server slurp the desired content.

  Hence the slurp middleware which slurps URLs and produces MIME coded
  data.
