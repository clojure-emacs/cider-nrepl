;;;; # The Debugger
;;; The debugger is divided into two parts, intrument.clj and
;;; debug.clj.
;;;
;;; - instrument.clj (which see), found in the util/ subdir, is
;;;   responsible for navigating a code data structure and
;;;   instrumenting all sexps of interest.
;;;
;;; - debug.clj is the debugger per se. It doesn't actually "look" at
;;;   the code it's being run on. It simply implements the breakpoint
;;;   logic as well as a number of functions to interact with the user
;;;   according to breakpoints placed by instrument.clj.
;;;
;;;   After the repl is started, before the debugger can be used, a
;;;   message must be sent by the client with the "init-debugger" op
;;;   (only one of these is necessary througout a session).
;;;   Afterwards, code can be instrumented by calling
;;;   `instrument-and-eval` on it (through the regular "eval" op).
;;;
;;;   Finally, when a breakpoint is reached due to running
;;;   instrumented code, an `need-debug-input` message is sent to the
;;;   client in response to the message used during initialization.
;;;   Execution of the code will halt until this message is replied.
;;;   It may specify a :prompt, it will specify an :input-type and a
;;;   :key, and it expects an :input key in the reply. The :key must
;;;   be contained in the reply, and :input-type may be:
;;;   - a vector of keywords, in which case one must be returned (but
;;;     note that the repl may convert these to non-keyword strings);
;;;   - the keyword :expression, in which case a single sexp must be
;;;     returned (as a string).

;;;; ## Internal breakpoint logic
;;; Variables and functions used for navigating between breakpoints.
