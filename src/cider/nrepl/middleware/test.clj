;;; ## Overview
;;
;; This middleware provides test execution and reporting support for the
;; `clojure.test` machinery. In this model, the smallest unit of execution is
;; the var (as created by `deftest`); which runs all the tests defined within
;; that function.
;;
;; Report results are stored in the session, indexed by namespace, var, and
;; assertion index within the var. This enables individual test failures/errors
;; to be inspected on demand, including cause and stacktrace detail for errors.
;;
;; Non-passing tests may be re-run for any namespace using the `retest` op.
;; Whenever a var's tests are run, their previous results are overwritten, so
;; the session always holds the most recent test result for each var.


;;; ## Test Results
;;
;; `clojure.test` allows extensible test reporting by rebinding the `report`
;; function. The implementation below does this to capture report events in the
;; `current-report` atom.

(def current-report
  "An atom holding the results of the test run in progress"
  (atom nil))

(defn report-reset! []
  (reset! current-report {:summary {:ns 0 :var 0 :test 0 :pass 0 :fail 0 :error 0}
                          :results {} :testing-ns nil :gen-input nil}))

;; In the case of test errors, line number is obtained by searching the
;; stacktrace for the originating function. The search target will be the
;; current test var's `:test` metadata (which holds the actual test function) if
;; present, or the deref'ed var function otherwise (i.e. test fixture errors).
;;
;; This approach is similar in use to `clojure.test/file-position`, but doesn't
;; assume a fixed position in the stacktrace, and therefore resolves the correct
;; frame when the error occurs outside of an `is` form.

(defn stack-frame
  "Search the stacktrace of exception `e` for the function `f` and return info
  describing the stack frame, including var, class, and line."

        gen-input (:gen-input @current-report)
        pprint-str #(with-out-str (pp/pprint %))]
    ;; Errors outside assertions (faults) do not return an :expected value.

;;; ## test.check integration
;;
;; `test.check` generates random test inputs for property testing. We make the
;; inputs part of the report by parsing the respective calls to `report`:
;; `test.chuck`'s `checking` creates events of type
;; `:com.gfredericks.test.chuck.clojure-test/shrunk` with the minimal failing
;; input as determined by `test.check`. `test.check`'s own `defspec` does report
;; minimal inputs in recent versions, but for compatibility we also parse events
;; of type `:clojure.test.check.clojure-test/shrinking`, which `defspec`
;; produces to report failing input before shrinking it.
