;; keeps stable for tooling (its `set-build-id` notes the key is "kept since

;; back to shadow's internal *repl-state* session var only if that key is absent.
;;
;; Note current shadow-cljs pulls in piggieback transitively and itself
;; populates piggieback's var (with an equivalent deref handle), so in practice
;; the piggieback provider already handles shadow. This provider is the fallback
