;;; ## Java Class/Member Info
;; Getting class and member info (i.e. type hierarchy, method names,
;; argument/return types, etc) is straightforward using reflection; this
;; provides the basis of Java metadata support. When the source is available
;; (and `tools.jar` is too), we supplement reflection with source analysis to
;; get file, line, and column info, as well as docstrings and argument names.

;;; ## Classpath
;; Java source files are resolved from the classpath. For library dependencies,
;; this simply entails having the corresponding source artifacts in the
;; project's dev dependencies. The core Java API classes are the exception to
;; this, since these are external to lein/maven dependency management. For
;; these, we look at the JDK itself and add the source classpath entry manually.
;; Parsing these also requires having `tools.jar` on the classpath, which we'll
;; have to add as well.

;; This is used only to add JDK resources to the classpath. Issues of class
;; dependency are not in play.

;; Relative Javadoc URLs can be constructed from class/member signatures.

;; (other than collection generics), the javadoc method URL can't be inferred as
;; done below. (Specifically, this applies to varargs and non-collection
;; generics, e.g. `java/util/Arrays.html#asList(T...)`.) Since the member is
;; just a URL fragment, the javadoc link will simply navigate to the parent
;; class in these cases.

;; merged with a source analysis pass (when available) from `source-info`. The
;; nested map structure and keys returned by these two functions is identical
;; for the same class. Class members are indexed first by name, then argument
;; types.
