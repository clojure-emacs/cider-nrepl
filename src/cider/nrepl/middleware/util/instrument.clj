;;;; # Instrumentation
;;;
;;; The following code is responsible for automatic instrumentation.
;;; This involves:
;;;    - knowing what's interesting and what's not,
;;;    - walking though the code,
;;;    - distinguishing function calls from special-forms,
;;;    - distinguishing between the different collections.

;;;; ## Auxiliary defs
(def dont-break-forms
  "Set of special-forms that we don't wrap breakpoints around.
  These are either forms that don't do anything interesting (like
  `quote`) or forms that just can't be wrapped (like `catch` and
  `finally`)."
  ;; `recur` needs to be handled separately.
  '#{quote catch finally})

;;;; ## Instrumentation
;;;
;;; The top-level instrumenting function is `read-and-instrument`. See
;;; its doc for more information.
;;;
;;; Each of the other `instrument-*` functions is responsible for
;;; calling subordinates and incrementing the coordinates vector if
;;; necessary.

;;;; ### Instrumenting Special forms
;;;
;;; Here, we implement instrumentation of special-forms on a
;;; case-by-case basis. Unlike function calls, we can't just look at
;;; each argument separately.
